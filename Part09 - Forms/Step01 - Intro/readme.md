# Step 01 - Intro

Since Angular is a single page application the forms are not submitted to the server but they are handled by Angular.

Angular creates an object that allows to retrieve easily form values and check if the form is valid.


## Approaches

Angular offers two different types of approach.

#### Template Driven

This approach allows to declare the form into the template and Angular will infer the form structure.

#### Reactive

This approach allows to declare the form structure with typescript code and the template and them with greater control.
