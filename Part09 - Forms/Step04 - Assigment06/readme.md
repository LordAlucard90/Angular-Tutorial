# Step 04 - Assignment 06

## Exercise

Add a Form with the following Inputs (and Validators)
1. Mail address (should not be empty and should be an email address)
2. A Dropdown which allows the user to select from three different Subscriptions ("Basic", "Advanced", "Pro"), set "Advanced" as Default
3. A Password field (should not be empty)
4. A Submit Button

Display a warning message if the Form is invalid AND was touched. Display a warning message below each input if it's invalid.

Upon submitting the form, you should simply print the Value of the Form to the Console.
Optionally, display it in your template.
