# Step 03 - Assignment 01

## Exercise

1. Create two new Components (manually or with CLI): WarningAlert and SuccessAlert
2. Output them beneath each other in the AppComponent
3. Output a warning or success message in the Components
4. Style the Components appropriately (maybe some red/ green text?)

Use external or internal templates and styles!

Feel free to create more components, nest them into each other or play around with different types of selectors!
