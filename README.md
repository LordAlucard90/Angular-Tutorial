# Angular-Tutorial
In this repository I'll made the steps of the "[Angular 7 (formerly Angular 2) - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/)" course.

The repository is divided by the main topics and each one is divided by the different course steps/lessons (step is not equal to video). Each step contains a readme with the explanation of the step and, if is change from the previous step, the new code.
