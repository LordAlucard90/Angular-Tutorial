# Angular-Tutorial
In this repository I'll made the steps of the 
"[Angular - The Complete Guide (2022 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/)" course.

The repository is divided by the main topics and
each one is divided by the different course steps/lessons (step is not equal to video).
Each step contains a readme with the explanation of the step and,
