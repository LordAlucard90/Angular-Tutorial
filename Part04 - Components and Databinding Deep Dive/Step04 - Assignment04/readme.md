# Step 04 - Assignment04

## Exercise

1. Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
2. The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
3. When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
4. The event should be listenable from outside the component
5. When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))
6. A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
7. Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
8. Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components
